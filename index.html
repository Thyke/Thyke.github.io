        <h1>Faruk Yıldırım</h1>
      </header>

      <p>My programming journey began with game hacking, but I quickly decided to channel my passion into game development instead. Currently, I'm deeply engaged in studying the Unreal Engine source code to understand its core mechanics and working extensively with the Gameplay Ability System. I possess comprehensive knowledge in animation programming, shaders, and various aspects of Unreal Engine. I develop high-level game mechanics and systems using both C++ and Blueprint in Unreal Engine. My goal is to continuously apply my expanding knowledge to create high-quality and innovative games. With extensive experience in both low-level and high-level programming, I bring a unique perspective to game development challenges.</p>
